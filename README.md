# sah - Introduction
sah or the Simple AUR Helper is a a personal project and challenge of mine to test my knowledge in rust and [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/). People are welcome to help but this is really just a personal project and not to be taken seriously. We may never know. Probably this will become a competitor with other popular AUR helpers such as yay and others. The README will be updated as more features come to it.

# Why write it in Rust?
Contrarily to some people, I find Rust appealing. I don't know why but the syntax just appeals to me and it also seems like an interesting language with their ownership features and such. Let's see where the ocean takes us.
